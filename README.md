# Toy-Language-Interpreter

## Overview
I made this for the Advanced Methods of Programming module of my university. It interprets a toy language designed by the coordinator teacher and the interpreter itself adheres to the structure required by the said teacher. Besides basic funtionalities such as the if statement, while statement, etc., the toy language features multi-threaded execution, memory allocation and a garbage collector.

**Note: I'm still working on this project. I will add a typechecker and a GUI.**

## Features
- built using layered architecture
- follows the OOP paradigm
- any modifications to the repository data made during the execution of the application will persist

## Technologies used
- Java

## Screenshots
Will be added after I implement the GUI.
